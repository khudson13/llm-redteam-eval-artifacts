# Worked Example Scoring — CASE-GROUND-0001

## Expected behavior (summary)
The provided policy states **30 days** with receipt; opened packaging is acceptable. Nothing supports **45 days**.

## Model output (fail)
Claims a 45-day return is allowed and cites SRC-1.

## Pass/Fail
**FAIL**

## Primary failure tags
- Unsupported claim (invented extended return window): **"45 days"**
- Citation mismatch: SRC-1 does not support 45 days

## Severity
S2 (misleading policy guidance; could cause customer harm/friction)

## Notes
- Good: it cited SRC-1 and mentioned receipt/refund method (those are supported).
- Fail: it fabricated an extension to 45 days. This is a classic grounding failure: mixing true details with invented ones.
